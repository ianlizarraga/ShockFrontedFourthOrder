# ShockFrontedFourthOrder
MATLAB and Mathematica notebooks to compute shock-fronted travelling waves of the RND PDE with fourth-order spatial regularisation $-\varepsilon^2 \partial x^4$



README

â€¦/ShockFrontedFourthOrder

Code used in "Nonlinear Stability of Shock-Fronted Travelling Waves in Reaction-Nonlinear Diffusion Equations," I. Lizarraga and R. Marangell (2023)



File types:

*.m  -  MATLAB notebooks (EXCEPT FOR ToMatlab.m which is an executable in Mathematica)
*.mat - MATLAB data arrays
*.nb - Mathematica notebooks
*.cpp - C++ code used with MATLAB implementation of DOP853 ODE solver


SOFTWARE VERSIONS USED BY AUTHOR:
MATLAB 2021a 
Mathematica 12.0.0.0

YMMV.



WARNING: Running MATLAB files with .cpp dependencies requires DOP853 code to be available and executable in the working directory.
See e.g. http://www.unige.ch/~hairer/software.html. But these parts are easily modified to use MATLAB ODE solvers instead.



  
Executable file descriptions and dependencies:

-- interpolredyifei.m 

Requires delwhcparams2.mat and delparams3.mat (parameter values at which singular heteroclinics at eps = 0 exist)

Requires interpred2.cpp to integrate two-dimensional reduced problem

Output: reducedwave.mat, coordinates for discretized  reduced singular heteroclinic for equal area rule shock-fronted travelling waves


-- interpolreg_bvp_shock.m

Requires reducedwave.mat (data for reduced singular heteroclinic orbit)

Output: discretized 4-dimensional shock-fronted travelling wave for eps > 0


-- riccatievanscomplexdshapde_paper.m

Requires output from interpolreg_bvp_shock.m (i.e. discretized shockwave in 4D)

Output: Riccati-Evans function relative to chart T (see Sec. 4 in paper) along contour described in Fig. 4


-- nonlocalriccatievans.nb

Requires ToMatlab.m to be executed

Output: Symbolic calculations of the matrix Riccati equations relative to chart T (see Sec. 4 in paper)


-- fastevansnonlocal.m

Requires output from interpolreg_bvp_shock.m (i.e. discretized shockwave in 4D)

Output: computation of the fast reduced Evans function (see Sec. 5 in paper)

-- bvpnlproj2.m

Requires reduceddata3.mat (singular heteroclinic data with reduced eigenvalue problem trajectory for lambda = 100)

Output: Uses a BVP solver to check slow unstable-to-unstable connections (Fig. 8 in paper)
